      <h1>How Long Does it Take to Draw a Dog?</h1>

        <p>
          Google has recently released an amazing dataset of <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data" target="_blank">over 50 million drawings</a> of 345 types of things, ranging from triangles to trombones.

        </p>
        <p>
          A number of great analyses have already been created, from <a href="" target="_blank">Cultural differences when drawing a circle</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://colinmorris.github.io/blog/bad_flamingos">Finding bad flamingo drawings</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this short visual exploration, we answer a simple question: how long are people spending on drawing these doodles?
          Let's start with dogs!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="figure" style="width:940px; height:480px;">
        <div class="graph" id="dog-hist"></div>
        <div id="dog-hist-annotation" class="annotation">
          <p class="title">Distribution of dog drawing times</p>
          <p>
            Mouse over bars to see example doodles<br/>
            drawn in that amount of time below.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="draw-dock" id="dog-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">

        <p>
          The above graph shows the distribution of time spent drawing a dog for the <strong>152,000</strong> dog doodles in the Quickdraw dataset.
          Only dogs correctly recongized by Google's algorithm as a <i>dog</i> are included.
        </p>

        <p>
          Browse through the examples to see what a 2 second dog looks like compared to a 10 second one.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can see the average amount of time spent drawing a dog was <strong>7.4 seconds</strong>. The times <strong>exclude pauses between strokes</strong>, which for dog drawings was an average of about <strong>3.4 seconds</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This leads to a second question: is 7.4 seconds a long time to spend doodling an animal? What about cats?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Dogs and Cats, Drawn Together</h2>

      <div class="figure" style="width:940px; height:480px;">
        <div class="graph" id="dogcat-hist"></div>
        <div class="annotation">
          <p class="title">Dogs vs cats</p>
          <div class="legend">
            <p><span class="box dog"></span> Dog drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box cat"></span> Cat drawings</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="draw-dock" id="dogcat-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Interesting, so people draw cats faster than dogs!
          On average, it takes almost <strong>2 additional seconds</strong> to draw a dog rather than a cat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could this be because people often draw just a cat head when drawing a cat, but are more likely to draw an entire dog when drawing a dog?
        </p>

        <p>
          What if we add one more mammal into the mix, one we (or at least I) would only recognize a full-body drawing of: <strong>horses</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="figure" style="width:940px; height:480px;">
        <div class="graph" id="dogcathorse-hist"></div>
        <div class="annotation">
          <p class="title">Dogs vs cats vs horses</p>
          <div class="legend">
            <p><span class="box dog"></span> Dog drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box cat"></span> Cat drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box horse"></span> Horse drawings</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="draw-dock" id="dogcathorse-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The average time for doodling horses is <strong>over 9 seconds</strong>!
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Do Master Works Take More Strokes?</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>I was expecting that </p>
      </div>

      <div class="figure" style="width:940px; height:480px;">
        <div class="graph" id="dogcathorse-strokes"></div>
        <div class="annotation">
          <p class="title">Distribution of stroke counts</p>
          <div class="legend">
            <p><span class="box dog"></span> Dog drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box cat"></span> Cat drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box horse"></span> Horse drawings</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          To see each distribuition more clearly, we can split them up into a small multiple.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="dogcathorse-strokes-small"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the stroke count distributions for these three doodles look quite different from one another.</p>
        <p>
          For dogs, we see a much higher proportion of drawings that use just 1 or 2 strokes. Cat drawings are much more normally distributed, and nobody used just one stroke. This makes sense as we always draw cat whiskers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Horse stroke count follows a completely different pattern. Over <strong>12%</strong> of the horse doodles were drawn without lifting the pen (or mouse, in this case). There are some impressive horse doodlers out there!
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Which was Drawn First, the Chicken or the Egg?</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Ok, ok, the Quickdraw dataset doesn't <i>really</i> include egg drawings, or even chickens, but I couldn't pass up the catchy title.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will end this brief analysis by looking at the drawing times of other groups of doodles.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, a flock of <strong>birds</strong>, with <i>circle</i> standing in for the egg.
      </div>
      <p class="right title">Bird drawing times</p>
      <div id="birds"></div>
      <div class="draw-dock" id="birds-draw"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          I was surprised that ducks take longer to draw (on average) than flamingos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, be sure to check out the <strong>1 second birds</strong> which are all the classic <i>curly V</i> of a bird in the distance. There's more than one way to draw a bird!
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="right title">Bug drawing times</p>
      <div id="bugs"></div>
      <div class="draw-dock" id="bugs-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          It is impressive anyone can draw a mosquito, especially in only 5 seconds.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="right title">Shape drawing times</p>
      <div id="shapes"></div>
      <div class="draw-dock" id="shapes-draw"></div>

      <h2>The End</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          That's it for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully this little look at draw times inspires more exploration of this great data set.
