          Google has recently released an amazing dataset of <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data" target="_blank">over 50 million drawings</a> of 345 types of things, ranging from triangles to trombones.

        </p>
        <p>
          A number of great analyses have already been created, from <a href="https://qz.com/994486/the-way-you-draw-circles-says-a-lot-about-you/" target="_blank">cultural differences when drawing a circle</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://colinmorris.github.io/blog/bad_flamingos">finding bad flamingo drawings</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this short visual exploration, we answer a simple question: how long are people spending on drawing these doodles?
          Let's start with dogs!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="figure" style="width:940px; height:480px;">
        <div class="graph" id="dog-hist"></div>
        <div id="dog-hist-annotation" class="annotation">
          <p class="title">Distribution of dog drawing times</p>
          <p>
            <i>Mouse over bars to see example doodles<br/>
            drawn in that amount of time below.</i>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="draw-dock" id="dog-draw">
      </div>

      <div class="text">

        <p>
          The above graph shows the distribution of time spent drawing a dog for the <strong>152,000</strong> dog doodles in the Quickdraw dataset.
          Only dogs correctly recongized by Google's algorithm as a <i>dog</i> are included.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mouse over the bars to see what a 2 second dog looks like compared to a 10 second one.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can see the average amount of time spent drawing a dog was <strong>7.4 seconds</strong>. The times <strong>exclude pauses between strokes</strong>, which for dog drawings was an average of about <strong>3.4 seconds</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This leads to a second question: is 7.4 seconds a long time to spend doodling an animal? What about cats?
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Dogs and Cats, Drawn Together</h2>

      <div class="figure" style="width:940px; height:480px;">
        <div class="graph" id="dogcat-hist"></div>
        <div class="annotation">
          <p class="title">Dogs vs cats</p>
          <div class="legend">
            <p><span class="box dog"></span> Dog drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box cat"></span> Cat drawings</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="draw-dock" id="dogcat-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          We can see that people draw cats faster than dogs!
          On average, it takes almost <strong>2 additional seconds</strong> to draw a dog rather than a cat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could this be because people often draw just a cat head when drawing a cat, but are more likely to draw an entire dog when drawing a dog?
        </p>

        <p>
          To test this theory, we can <strong>overlay</strong> a bunch of the doodles from each time slice on top of one another.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p class="title">100 cats drawn in 0 - 1 seconds</p>

      </div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          We can see the pointy ears and round face of the cat in all these composite images.
          This is not the case for the dog images. While its harder to make out, we see more horizontal arcs in the dog groups, forming the bodies of many dogs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the bottom portions of the dog composites are noticably sparser, as this is where people are drawing legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, what if we add one more mammal into the mix?
          Let's take a look at <strong>horses</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="figure" style="width:940px; height:480px;">
        <div class="graph" id="dogcathorse-hist"></div>
        <div class="annotation">
          <p class="title">Dogs vs cats vs horses</p>
          <div class="legend">
            <p><span class="box dog"></span> Dog drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box cat"></span> Cat drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box horse"></span> Horse drawings</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="draw-dock" id="dogcathorse-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The average time for doodling horses is <strong>over 9 seconds</strong>!
          And again, it appears that almost all the horses are drawn in their entirety: head, shoulders, knees, and hooves.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Do Master Works Take More Strokes?</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>I was expecting that the doodles that take longer to draw - like horses, would use more strokes. This appears <strong>not</strong> to be the case.</p>
        <p>
          Let's look at the distribution of <strong>stroke counts</strong> now instead of drawing times.
          To see each distribuition more clearly, I split them up into a small multiple below.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="figure" style="width:940px; height:480px;">
        <div class="graph" id="dogcathorse-strokes"></div>
        <div class="annotation">
          <p class="title">Distribution of stroke counts</p>
          <div class="legend">
            <p><span class="box dog"></span> Dog drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box cat"></span> Cat drawings</p>
            <p><span class="box horse"></span> Horse drawings</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="dogcathorse-strokes-small"></div>
      <div id="dogcathorse-strokes-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the stroke count distributions for these three doodles look quite different from one another.</p>
        <p>
          For dogs, we see a much higher proportion of drawings that use just 1 or 2 strokes. Cat drawings are much more normally distributed, and nobody used just one stroke. This makes sense as we always draw cat whiskers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Horse stroke count follows a completely different pattern. Over <strong>12%</strong> of the horse doodles were drawn without lifting the pen (or mouse, in this case). There are some impressive horse doodlers out there!
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Which was Drawn First, the Chicken or the Egg?</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Ok, ok, the Quickdraw dataset doesn't <i>really</i> include egg drawings, or even chickens, but I couldn't pass up the catchy title.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will end this brief analysis by looking at the drawing times of other groups of doodles.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, a flock of <strong>birds</strong>.
      </div>
      <p class="title">Bird drawing times</p>
      <div id="birds"></div>
      <div class="draw-dock" id="birds-draw"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          I was surprised that ducks take longer to draw (on average) than flamingos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, be sure to check out the <strong>1 second birds</strong> which are all the classic <i>curly V</i> of a bird in the distance.
          I guess there's more than one way to draw a bird!
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="title">Bug drawing times</p>
      <div id="bugs"></div>
      <div class="draw-dock" id="bugs-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          It is impressive that anyone can draw a mosquito, especially in only 5 seconds.
          It is also impressive just how much work people put into doodling arthropods.
          Check out those detailed scorpions!
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="title">Shape drawing times</p>
      <div id="shapes"></div>
      <div class="draw-dock" id="shapes-draw"></div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          As expected, simple shapes are a lot quicker to draw.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Exploring All Categories</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          We can look briefly at these summary statistics for all doodle categories using this handy dandy swarm plot. Check out the stroke count for hedgehogs!

      <h2>The End</h2>

          That's it for now.
